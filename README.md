# Arclinks - Particle Network Demo

Here is our functional demo showcase:
We use a simplistic interface to demonstrate how we incorporate Particle Network into Arclinks to launch GPT service.

You can access our website at [Arclinks-Chat](www.arclinks.org) . Upon logging in, you will be prompted to "Please connect wallet". Any input in this phrase will be rejected with the response "Please connect wallet". However, you can click the "Connect Wallet" button in the upper right corner to call out the Particle Network SDK.

You can now authenticate your credentials through a wide selection of services or wallets provided by Particle Network.
For instance, suppose you want to connect your Metamask wallet to access your AI PASS NFT from Arclinks. When you navigate to the Arclinks website and click the "Connect Wallet" button, the Particle Network webpage will be called, and the Metamask plugin will activate and prompt you to sign in.

Once you have signed in, you will be able to utilize the GPT service provided by Arclinks. This service includes a wide range of capabilities, such as the ability to ask any questions you might have, create new chats, and even use Masks, a user-friendly tool that enables GPT to take on the roles of specific characters, resulting in more detailed and engaging responses.
